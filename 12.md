# MCC-SWAT-SDML Architecture Overview

## System: S1 & S24 Use Cases

This document provides a concise overview of the MCC-SWAT-SDML architecture for two distinct use cases: S1 and S24.

---

## Use Cases Overview

### S1 Use Case
**Purpose:** Trade Surveillance + eComms Surveillance  
**Data Sources:**
- Trading Hub (Trade Surveillance) - L3 Closed alerts
- Behavox (eComms Surveillance) - L3 Closed alerts

**Scope:**
- Alert Level: L3 Closed alerts only
- Data Types: Trades + Ecomms

### S24 Use Case
**Purpose:** Trade Surveillance Only  
**Data Source:**
- Trading Hub (Trade Surveillance) - L1 & L2 US alerts

**Scope:**
- Alert Level: L1 & L2 US alerts
- Data Type: Trade data only

---

## Architecture Components

### Core Systems

**SWAT**
- Entry point for data from both use cases
- Receives data from S1 and S24 sources (dotted line connection)

**SDML**
- Data management layer
- Processes S1 use case data only

**MCC**
- Final destination for all data
- Receives S1 data via SDML
- Receives S24 data directly from SWAT

---

## Data Flows

### S1 Use Case Data Flow
```
Trading Hub (Trades - L3 Closed) ┐
                                  ├──> SWAT ──> SDML ──> MCC
Behavox (Ecomms - L3 Closed)     ┘
```

1. **S1 Trades** from Trading Hub (L3 Closed alerts)
2. **S1 Ecomms** from Behavox (L3 Closed alerts)
3. Both flow to **SWAT** (via dotted line)
4. Enriched data flows to **SDML**
5. Final destination: **MCC**

### S24 Use Case Data Flow
```
Trading Hub (Trades - L1 & L2 US) ──> SWAT ──> MCC
```

1. **S24 Trades** from Trading Hub (L1 & L2 US alerts)
2. Data flows to **SWAT** (via dotted line)
3. **Direct flow to MCC** (bypasses SDML)

---

## Technical Details

### Security
- **mTLS** (mutual TLS) across all integrations

### Automation
- **Autosys** scheduling
  - Scheduled preload and refresh operations
  - Configured as per SLA requirements
  - Handles Trades & Ecomms data preload

## Release Timeline

| Use Case | Component | Release Date |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| S1 | Trades | June |
| S1 | Ecomms | August |
| S24 | Trade data | August |

---

## Key Differentiators

| Aspect | S1 Use Case | S24 Use Case |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Data Sources** | Trading Hub + Behavox | Trading Hub only |
| **Surveillance Type** | Trades + eComms | Trades only |
| **Alert Levels** | L3 Closed | L1 & L2 US |
| **Flow to MCC** | Via SDML | Direct from SWAT |
| **Connection to SWAT** | Dotted line | Dotted line |

## Complete Architecture Flow

```
S1 Sources (Trading Hub + Behavox) ┐
                                    ├─ ─ ─> SWAT ──┬──> SDML ──> MCC
S24 Source (Trading Hub)           ┘                │
                                                    └─────────────> MCC
```

*Note: Dotted lines (─ ─ ─) indicate connections between data sources and SWAT*

All communications are secured using mTLS, and data flows are orchestrated through Autosys scheduling to meet SLA requirements.
